# CS360

App Purpose and User Goals

The mobile application developed for CS 360 is a Writing Project Tracker App intended for writers managing long-term creative work. The primary goal of the app is to help users structure their writing process by organizing planning sessions, writing days, editing tasks, and deadlines in one place. This app was designed to support consistency and progress for writers who do not always work within fixed schedules, such as students, independent authors, or freelancers.

Rather than functioning as a general task manager, the app focuses on writing-specific needs. It allows users to create dated events with notes and reminders so they can track both progress and upcoming commitments. The overall objective was to reduce mental overhead and make it easier for writers to stay engaged with ongoing projects.

User Interface Design and Features

The app includes screens for user authentication, event creation, and event review. These screens were selected intentionally to support the most common actions a user would perform: adding writing sessions, checking deadlines, and reviewing previously logged work. The interface was designed to be simple and readable, with a clear layout and minimal navigation steps.

User-centered design principles guided the UI decisions throughout the project. Inputs and buttons are clearly labeled, screens follow a predictable flow, and visual clutter is avoided. These design choices were effective because they allow users to interact with the app quickly without needing instructions or prior experience.

Development Process and Coding Approach

The coding process was approached incrementally, with functionality built and tested in stages. Core features were implemented first to establish a stable foundation before refining layout details and user interactions. Keeping the project modular and well-organized made it easier to identify issues and make adjustments as development progressed.

Clear variable naming, consistent file organization, and reusable patterns were used to maintain readability. These techniques are transferable to future mobile development projects, particularly when working on larger applications that require ongoing updates or collaboration.

Testing and Validation

Testing was performed continuously during development to confirm that screens loaded correctly, user input was processed as expected, and navigation between components functioned properly. Verifying functionality throughout the build process helped prevent errors from accumulating and ensured the app remained usable at each stage.

This testing process is essential in mobile development because usability issues directly affect user trust. Testing revealed opportunities to improve screen flow and reinforced the importance of validating functionality early and often.

Challenges and Problem Solving

One of the main challenges was translating initial design concepts into a fully functional Android application. Adapting UI designs to Android Studio’s layout system required experimentation and revision. In some cases, planned features needed to be simplified to align with technical constraints while still meeting user needs.

Problem solving during this phase involved adjusting layouts, refining logic, and prioritizing usability over unnecessary complexity. These decisions allowed the project to remain focused and achievable.

Demonstrated Skills and Strengths

The strongest aspect of this project was the successful integration of planning, design, and implementation. The final app reflects the original design intent while functioning as a complete mobile application. This project demonstrates my ability to apply user-centered design principles, organize a mobile development workflow, and deliver a functional Android app suitable for inclusion in a professional portfolio.
